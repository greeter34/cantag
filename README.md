This is a work in progress. My coding skills AREN'T the greatest, so please don't expect this project to take place at warp speed :-)

Linux users can clone the repo and then simply run the following to get an executable:

make linux

Linux users who have the proper tools installed can also make a static windows binary by running the following:

make windows

More updates will be coming.
